# PointNet-pytorch
An easy-to-use implementation of the PointNet architecture for 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. Based on the original paper by Qi et al. (2017), this repository aims to make PointNet accessible for learning, experimentation, and practical use in deep learning on 3D data.
